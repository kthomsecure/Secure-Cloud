# osTicket Lab Installation Log

This repository documents the troubleshooting and successful deployment of osTicket inside a Windows-based virtual machine hosted in Azure. The goal of this project was to simulate a practical help desk ticketing system configuration while navigating IIS, PHP, and firewall rules‚Äîdemonstrating applied IT support and system admin skills.

## ‚úÖ Lab Goal

Install and configure osTicket on a Windows Server VM in Azure using IIS, PHP, and MySQL. Resolve common configuration issues along the way to gain real-world troubleshooting experience.

## üîß Environment

- **Virtual Machine:** Windows Server (Azure-hosted)
- **Web Server:** IIS 10
- **PHP Version:** 7.3.8
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Firewall:** Azure Network Security Group (NSG)
- **Browser:** Edge (localhost testing)
- **Local system:** macOS (host system using RDP)

## üîç Issues Encountered & Resolved

### 1. **HTTP Error 500.19**
- **Cause:** Invalid or malformed `web.config` file.
- **Fix:** Renamed corrupted or default file to `web.config.old` and allowed osTicket to recreate it properly.

### 2. **Handler Mapping Issue**
- **Cause:** Missing PHP handler for `.php` files in IIS.
- **Fix:** Used IIS Manager to confirm and restore `php-7.3.8` handler mappings using `FastCgiModule`.

### 3. **Firewall Block**
- **Cause:** Port 80 was not reachable from browser.
- **Fix:** Checked Azure NSG rules to ensure `Allow-HTTP` (port 80) was set to "Allow" for inbound traffic.

### 4. **Configuration File Missing**
- **Cause:** osTicket reported missing `ost-config.php`.
- **Fix:** Renamed `include/ost-sampleconfig.php` to `include/ost-config.php`.
